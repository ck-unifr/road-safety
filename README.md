# Police Officer Attending Prediction

Author: Kai Chen

Date: April, 2020


This repository contains my solution of analyzing the road accident safety data found at 

https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data .


- This analysis includes a model that predicts if a police officer is likely to attend an accident or not.

- The analysis focuses initially only on the accidents from the 2017 dataset.

- This is not an exercise that develops a final solution â€“ more of first iteration.

- A notebook summarizes my initial findings. 

- The notebook describes how I might design and implement for a long term approach a data infrastructure for processing all additional data (large amount including all available years) given the desired use case above.


The repository contains:

* ./notebook/accident_prediction.ipynb: the notebook contains the steps of my solution.
* ./slides/accident_prediction.pdf: the slides which summarize my solution.
